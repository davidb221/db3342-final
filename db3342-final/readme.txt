Author: David Barboza Uni:db3342 Final

The final consisted of making a website with three pages.

The home page is exactly what the assignment specifies.
It conatins some of my personal information as well as links to
my other pages and a link to my favorite website(YouTube).

The classes page I got from the recommendations and followed the format
of listing my classes and then detailing my favorite class so far.

For my third page, I made a page of my interests and detailed three of my
interests and included a small description of each.

The code uses flask in python and read html files which simply use the
paragraph function (<p></p>) to detail text. I also added links and a photo
to the main page.
